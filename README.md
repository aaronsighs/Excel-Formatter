# Excel-Formatter
using pandas, read in multiple excel files and format them to one similar to format. So they can be manipulated later more easily

This project was something I used while working with large excel files for a freighting company,
multiple files would come in with varations in header names, at this time I used this to collectively group all freight data and compare this large data set.
